            <h2>Privacy Policy - Block Game</h2>
            <p><em>Last updated: January 29, 2026</em></p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how Block Game ("the Game", "we", "our", or "us") 
                collects, uses, and shares information when you play our game. This policy is 
                specific to Block Game and supplements the general PassiveProject Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>When you play Block Game, we may collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Game Progress:</strong> Your game scores, levels completed, and achievements</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Time spent playing, game sessions, and gameplay statistics</li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, and screen resolution</li>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Game saves and preferences stored on your device</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Save your game progress and settings</li>
                <li>Provide personalized gaming experience</li>
                <li>Track achievements and leaderboards</li>
                <li>Improve game performance and fix bugs</li>
                <li>Develop new features and game modes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Storage</h3>
            <p>
                Block Game stores most data locally on your device using browser local storage. 
                This means your game progress is saved on your device and is not automatically 
                synced to our servers unless you explicitly enable cloud sync features.
            </p>

            <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>
                Block Game may use third-party analytics services to understand how players 
                interact with the game. These services may collect information sent by your 
                device. We only work with services that respect user privacy.
            </p>

            <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>
                Block Game is designed to be family-friendly and suitable for all ages. We do 
                not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe 
                a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Security</h3>
            <p>
                We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information. However, 
                since most data is stored locally on your device, we recommend using device 
                security features like passwords and encryption.
            </p>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear your local game data at any time through your browser settings</li>
                <li>Opt out of analytics tracking</li>
                <li>Request deletion of any server-stored data</li>
                <li>Access information about what data we collect</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any 
                changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
            </p>
