                This Application targets a mixed audience, including children, families, and general users.
                We are committed to protecting the privacy of children and complying with the <strong>Google Play

                We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information (such as name, address, email, or phone
                number) from children.
                If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please

                <br>
                We serve ads to users of all ages. When the user is known to be a child, or for general audiences where
                age is unknown,
                we ensure that displayed ads are appropriate for children and come from <strong>Google Play Certified Ad
                    Networks</strong> (specifically Google AdMob).
                We configure our ad requests to be treated as child-directed content where applicable, in compliance
                with COPPA and GDPR.
